# Malkata Staya

Malkata Staya is an web application that provides property management and rental services.

This was done as part of my semester long project.

The back-end RESTFUL service is developed using Java & Spring Boot and dependencies are managed using Gradle. The frontend was made with React. A main focus of the semester was learning the basics of web-security, and understanding the need for extensive testing which included; unit, API, frontend and end to end tests.

The project also worked with the Gitlab CI/CD to ensure working code and continious delivery to Docker.

**Note:**
This project was originally hosted on GitLab and has been transferred to GitHub. As a result, the commit history for this repository starts from a single commit. This is because the project was cloned from GitLab and committed as a single commit in the new GitHub repository.
